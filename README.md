# UO Aeternum: A seasonal T2A-style mountless server.

## In Development Features

### Murderer System:
- In order to attack innocent players, you must be a murderer. 
- To become a murderer, go to the chaos shrine and say "I am ready to embrace chaos." You must have 10000 gold on your person or in your bank account to do this. (?)
- Murderers can not enter many regions unless they're carrying a "Stone of Malice" (or something). These regions include dungeons and some gathering regions.
- A "Stone of Malice" is an item that drops from some evil mobs and can be traded between players.
- A "Stone of Malice" can be traded to any Paladin NPC for some amount of gold or rewards.

### Early Cash Pressure:
- There are several valuable things to do with cash early, and how quickly you get early cash and what you decide to do with it can have ripple effects.
- Vendor House Spot: a classic, you can go for an early crafter and sell supplies
- Boat: Remote island spawns give more cash than moongate connected islands, and runes to these islands can be valuable guild resources early
- Guild Stone: TBD, substantial benefits for getting your guild stone down
- House NPCs/Addons: TBD, most likely there will be NPCs/Addons to help you gain skills and also to make houses near farming spots stronger (res stone? free reags in house?)
