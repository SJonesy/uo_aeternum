# [UO Aeternum](https://github.com/SJonesy/uo_aeternum/tree/main): A seasonal T2A-style mountless server.

## In Development Features

### Seasonality
- While accounts will persist, all items, characters, and houses will be wiped regularly (ever 3-4 months?).
- Accounts will earn permanent cosmetic unlocks from gaining achievements during a season.
- The server is being designed from the ground up to make starting over as interesting as possible.
- A large number of [tweakable seasonal settings](https://github.com/SJonesy/uo_aeternum/blob/main/Config/Seasonal.cfg) make each season feel different, while maintaining the beloved core T2A mountless gameplay.

### Achievements
- During each season, there will be approximately 40 achievements to complete.
- Getting 10 will be easy, getting all 40 will be extremely hard. Getting all 40 an 3 accounts should be impossible.
- Seasonal rewards will scale with how many achievements you get in a season.
- There will also be seasonal rewards for getting a single, specific achievement.

### Murderer System
- In order to attack innocent players, you must be a murderer. 
- To become a murderer, go to the chaos shrine and say "I am ready to embrace chaos." You must have 10000 gold on your person or in your bank account to do this. (?)
- Murderers can not enter many regions unless they're carrying a "Stone of Malice" (or something, wearing "an amulet of protection from good"?). These regions include dungeons and some gathering regions.
- A "Stone of Malice" is an item that drops from some evil mobs and can be traded between players.
- A "Stone of Malice" can be traded to any Paladin NPC for some amount of gold or rewards.

### Early Cash Pressure
- Due to the seasonal nature, the server needs a series of interesting and meaningful choices when it comes to boostrapping 3 fresh accounts. This section outlines early thoughts on how to make the gold you earn and spend interesting.
- Vendor House Spot: have craftable-only items that are highly valuable, so that placing a vendor house and selling these items to other players is a strong strategy.
- Boat: Remote island spawns give more cash than moongate connected islands, and runes to these islands can be valuable guild resources early
- Guild Stone: TBD, substantial benefits for getting a guild stone down. 
- House NPCs/Addons: TBD, most likely there will be NPCs/Addons to help you gain skills and also to make houses near farming spots stronger (res stone? free reags in house? free gate from house to town? bank deposit?)
