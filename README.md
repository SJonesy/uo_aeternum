# [UO Aeternum](https://github.com/SJonesy/uo_aeternum/tree/main): A seasonal T2A-style mountless server.

## In Development Features

### Housing and Guild Towns
- Players can not place houses freely.
- Guild Leaders can place a "Tree of Life" which creates an area of size [Width]x[Height] in which guild members can place houses, decorations, and NPCs.
- Trees of Life can be destroyed.
   - Interacting with the "Tree of Life" lets guild leaders pick a vulnerability window. This can be changed once a week and defaults to NA prime time.
   - During the vulnerability window, anyone can place a "Banestone", which is a destructible object. While a "Banestone" is present in a town:
      - Everyone in the town will flag as grey.
      - The Tree of Life will be vulnerable to attack.
      - After an hour, the Banestone disappears and the town is no longer vulnerable.
   - When a Tree of Life dies, all housing collapses, decorations are destroyed, and NPCs are despawned.
   - Whoever placed the "Banestone" receives a check in their bank box equal to the price of the banestone plus a portion of the value of the town.
- Towns come with lots of benefits that scale with the value of the town. Examples:
   - Every week, there is a zero-sum roll between all towns where a single town's members will all receive a cosmetic unlock.
   - Daily permanent account cosmetics unlock chance NPCs.
   - Discounted reagent vendors. 
   - Training NPCs.
   - Powerful NPC "Guards" that attack non-friendlies.
   - Hourly free magic items.
   - Automatic resource harvesting in the area.
   - Taxable housing.

### Seasonality
- While accounts will persist, all items, characters, and towns will be wiped regularly (every 3-4 months?).
- Accounts will earn permanent cosmetic unlocks from gaining achievements during a season.
- The server is being designed from the ground up to make starting over as interesting as possible.
- A large number of [tweakable seasonal settings](https://github.com/SJonesy/uo_aeternum/blob/main/Config/Seasonal.cfg) make each season feel different, while maintaining the beloved core T2A mountless gameplay.

### Achievements
- During each season, there will be approximately 40 achievements to complete.
- Getting 10 will be easy, getting all 40 will be extremely hard. Getting all 40 an 3 accounts should be impossible.
- Seasonal rewards will scale with how many achievements you get in a season.
- There will also be seasonal rewards for getting a single, specific achievement.

### Murderer System
- In order to attack innocent players, you must be a murderer. 
- To become a murderer, go to the chaos shrine and say "I am ready to embrace chaos." There may be some fee to do this.
- Murderers can not enter many regions unless they're carrying a "Stone of Malice" (or something, wearing "an amulet of protection from good"?). These regions include dungeons and some gathering regions.
- A "Stone of Malice" is an item that drops from some evil mobs and can be traded between players.
- A "Stone of Malice" can be traded to any Paladin NPC for some amount of gold or rewards.

## Misc Thoughts as I have them
- No hostile actions on Moonglow island; it's protected by the council of mages
- NPCs that only murderers can farm that are very good cash. A town of citizens that are mobs. The idea being that reds can be actively hunted because they'll be farming, so whatever this ends up being make travel in and out limited. 
- Think of other ways to make playing a red feel more like a lifestyle choice-- shops that only murderers can use? NPCs that only murderers can hire? Obviously reds will always be an alt of someone with a blue, but the idea is that some individuals will spend the majority of their time on a red.
- Secure place to trade kinda like Shelter Island on Outlands. Maybe a hub for all instanced content.
- "Focus" skill lets you meditate through armor? Plate mage builds are really cool..
- PvP Event: first team to either "capture a flag" or kill 33% of the enemy team wins the round, best of 5. Flag spawns after 2 minutes. Mounted versions of this event are the only time mounts are available on the server.
- 3 faction PvP system, Order/Chaos/Balance. Old School parry mages, and find a custom shield for the balance faction.
- PvE class based system. Wearable/tradeable/lootable items that give you a set of "class" powers. These don't overwrite your existing template, so class + skills creates a large variety of PvE options.
   - Warrior: Damage mitigation, taunt, bleed proc
   - Shadowknight: Damage mitigation, taunt, lifetap proc
   - Paladin: Damage mitigation, taunt, AoE heal proc
   - Priest: AoE pulse heal, AoE Bandage, AoE buffs
   - Wizard: Extra Spell Damage, Increased Mana Regen
- Characters have a PvE "level" that gives them direct bonuses depending on what class they have activated.
- Early Cash Pressure
   - Due to the seasonal nature, the server needs a series of interesting and meaningful choices when it comes to boostrapping 3 fresh accounts. This section outlines early thoughts on how to make the gold you earn and spend interesting.
   - Getting a Tree of Life and valuable town upgrades down.
   - Boat: Remote island spawns give more cash than moongate connected islands, and runes to these islands can be valuable guild resources early
